## Notes
My personal dotfiles.
Most of this stuff is temporary.
A lot of the files contain placeholder variables for sensitive data like passwords and usernames.
Those files are:
* .gitconfig
* .mpdasrc
* .msmtprc
* .fdm.conf
* .netrc

## Dependencies
In this section I will be listing each config file and which piece of software they are specifically for.
